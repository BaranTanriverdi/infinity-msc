      "changes": "- No direct changes detected to `$.business.userPopulations`; existing user groups (including Product Manager) remain as documented⚠️.\n- Infrastructure updates to Docker templates and CPU/Intel-specific Dockerfiles for `infinity_emb` may affect deployment and operational characteristics, but not declared user populations.\n- Internal library updates (optional imports, Optimum-based embedder utilities, and tests) refine how transformer embeddings are implemented and validated, without altering the System Card’s business-facing fields.\n- No new or removed System Card fields identified as part of this run; monitoring continues for future schema or policy-impacting changes.",

It packages transformer-based embedders (including Optimum-backed models) plus Dockerized runtimes for deployment in CPU-oriented environments. The library’s responsibilities include managing optional model dependencies, exposing a stable embedding interface, and ensuring test coverage so embedding behavior remains consistent across hardware targets and container builds used by product teams.",
